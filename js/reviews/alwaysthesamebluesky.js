    "Experience a light romance as a ♂️ or ♀️, with a ♀️ from your new class. Let her show you around the small city, close to the sea. It turns a bit philosophical from time to time. :b The story is very short and doesn’t get much longer with the extra endings. The tempo lays a bit high, but the well structured plot makes up for that. It had a nice twist in it. <br /><b>Gameplay</b><br /> There are multiple choices that have an influence on how much the girl likes you and so, the ending, of which there are 2 (1 good, 1 bad). <br /><b>Language</b><br /> " +
    "All English was very clear.",
               
    "Both the protagonist and the other girl are searching for their way around in life. They don't get that much time to \"evolve\" through the short story, but it seems to work out well. The girl seems really expressive, which makes her look very cute. ^.^",
               
    "The art was stunning. I’m amazed by how all the art styles work together so well. Lot’s of the backgrounds are very detailed but are painted in a style that blurs it a little (like oil or water painting?). The characters are, just like the backgrounds, colored with a variety of soft colors, but are more detailed, so the focus is still on them.",
               
    "There are multiple scenes with landscapes. The instrumental music makes you calm down while you take in the sound of the water. It fulfilled its role well.",
               
    "Nothing to see here. :b",

    "Would I buy it again? Hell yeah! The story is small, but the price is as well. Just the art only already makes it worthy."
