"This is a very short mystery horror-themed visual novel in which you play as a ♀️ (1st person) that got stuck in a time loop, so be prepared to use the skip button. :)
It all starts in a typical school scene but swiftly takes some dark turns.<br /><b>Gameplay</b><br />The gameplay felt really interactive, which made the story feel longer than it actually was. There are many choices of which almost all of them are important either directly or indirectly (on the next loop). The 1 good ending isn’t exactly a walk through the park (or it wasn’t for me at least). Furthermore, there are 3 bad endings, so please make different saves frequently. Also, routes aren’t always what they seem like, so don’t be scared of the ‘bad routes’ either.<br /> Even though there is a character that has feelings for you, don’t expect any romance, because the main protagonist doesn’t return them.<br /><b>Language</b><br />No problems with the English whatsoever.",
    "The story clearly does a lot to the characters. The whole experience makes the protagonist evolve in perspective and knowledge. Her inner thoughts are also expressed. The other characters are all very expressive mainly because of their art.",
    "The characters’ style was anime-themed but definitely could use an upgrade. The lines are really missing some flow (and some slight differences in their line widths can do wonders too). Their colors are good though, in contrast to the profile pictures of the characters. I suggest giving those at least some background color or colored layer over them (e.g. in the color of their hair), then you recognize the character that’s talking more easily.",
    "The instrumental music wasn’t present as much as usual. You’ll have to spend some story in silence from time to time, which made the tension (and my adrenaline :b) even higher. The music that you do hear is only of a small catalog, but it didn’t bother me at all since you skip your way through most of the repeats anyway.",
    "Nothing to see here. :b",
    "<table><tr><th>Story</th><td>😃</td></tr><tr><th>Characters</th><td>🙂</td></tr><tr><th>Art</th><td>😒</td></tr><tr><th>Music</th><td>😐</td></tr><tr><th>Sexual content</th><td>/</td></tr></table><br/>"+
    "Please keep in mind that this table only represents to what extent the element convinced me to buy/pay for the novel, which has nothing to do with the quality of it.",
    "Although I probably wouldn’t have been triggered to buy it since the art isn’t exactly seductive, I was completely sucked into the story. Since the price is so cheap (€2.39 in Belgium), it was worth it to me and so I would probably buy it. I do really hope the developer practices line fluency a bit more. ;)"
